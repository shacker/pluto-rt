# Pluto: Real-time web results for long-running processes

Any time you have a need to trigger a long-running process from a web view,
you run into Python's blocking nature. Nothing will be displayed until the
process is complete, and you'll hit timeouts if you exceed the default timeout
for your web application process.

To solve the long-running aspect, we turn to background workers like django-q
or django-celery. But then the user has no insight into what the background
worker is doing.

This system solves that by using a library called [QR3](https://pypi.org/project/qr3/), which
utilizes Redis as a message queuing service. Messages can be placed on the queue and their order is
remembered automatically. As messages are retrieved from the queue, it automatically delivers the
oldest ones first. Retrieved messages are automatically removed from the queue, so that the oldest
ones are always the ones you want to see next.

The overall strategy is this:

1. Invoke your background processor (worker) with a unique queue name
1. The worker places messages onto the queue, associated with that name
1. A private internal API retrieves and removes the oldest `n` messages from that queue
1. Javascript polling from the web view appends the results of each gulp to a display table


## Prerequisites

We assume you already have these installed and working

- A running Django project
- A running Redis server
- A base project template called `base.html` (use a custom template if not - see below)
- Your `base.html` pulls in extra javascript with `{% block extra_js %}{% endblock extra_js %}`
- A runnning background processor such as django-q or django-celery
- A standalone function that processes data and whose real-time output you want to display
- A `KEY_PREFIX` is defined in in your project cache settings, e.g.

```
CACHES = {
    "default": {
        ...
        "BACKEND": "django_redis.cache.RedisCache",
        "KEY_PREFIX": config.REDIS_PREFIX,  # or some fixed string for your project
        ...
    }
}
```

## Installation:

- `pip install qr3` (or add it to your project dependencies)
- Add `rt` to the list of installed apps in project settings.
- To enable the internal API, add to your top-level urls.py:

```
path("rt_messages/", include("rt.urls")),
```

## Usage
There are two views you'll need to control: the view that kicks off the process
and passes tasks to the background worker, and the view that consumes the results.

### Calling the process

First: Work to be done should be defined in a single function, which will be passed
to the background worker. See `proj_1/someapp/operations.py` in this repo
for example.

The calling view should generate a descriptive queue name, made relatively unique
with an ID (upload ID works well for this). It should invoke your background
processor with that function and the queue name as arguments, then redirect to the
display view. For example:

```
def post(self, request):
    upload_id = request.POST.get("upload_id")
    queue_name = f"demo_run_{upload_id}"
    async_task(
        sample_ops_function,
        queue_name=queue_name,
    )
    return redirect(reverse("rt_demo", kwargs={"queue_name": queue_name}))
```

### Displaying results

The display view receives the queue name as an argument, and polls the
internal API with that queue name plus arguments for controlling
how many items per "gulp" to grab, and how long to wait between gulps.

The display view should be handled something like this:

```
context = {
    "queue_name": queue_name,
    "num_per_gulp": 3,
    "interval_seconds": 2
}
return render(request, "rt_results.html", context)
```

This assumes you want to use the bundled rendering template, which assumes
your site is using Bootstrap. To customize its appearance or behavior, copy the
bundled template into a location of your choice and specify it in the
`render` call above.

The three context items are required:

- You must pass the generated queue name on to the template.
- You must tell the template how many items to pull from the queue per "gulp" (cycle)
- You must tell the template how long to wait between gulps.

Each use case is different, so modify the numeric args to suit.
